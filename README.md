Mender: Device remote control
=============================

## General

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux
devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as
a server that manages deployments across many devices.

This repository contains the Mender Device Connect microservice, which is part
of the Mender server. The Mender server is designed as a microservices architecture
and comprises several repositories.

## Getting started

To start using Mender, we recommend that you begin with the Getting started
section in [the Mender documentation](https://docs.mender.io/).

## Building from source

As the Mender server is designed as microservices architecture, it requires several
repositories to be built to be fully functional. If you are testing the Mender server it
is therefore easier to follow the getting started section above as it integrates these
services.

If you would like to build the Device Connect microservice independently, you can follow
these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/mendersoftware/deviceconnect.git
cd deviceconnect
make build
```
